Things to work on:

work on concept drift and seasonal variations
achieved:
Seasonal variations are introduced through the sine wave and noise.
Concept drift is achieved by adjusting the amplitude of the sine wave over time.
Dynamic anomaly detection is handled by continuously recalculating the threshold based on the moving window of data points.


optimise by using vectorized operations with NumPy or consider different anomaly detection methodsthat are faster for large data streams

work on documentation

explain chosen algorithm

add error handling
