Things to work on:

work on concept drift and seasonal variations
achieved:
- Seasonal variations are introduced through the sine wave and noise.
- Concept drift is achieved by adjusting the amplitude of the sine wave over time.
- Dynamic anomaly detection is handled by continuously recalculating the threshold based on the moving window of data points.


optimise by using vectorized operations with NumPy or consider different anomaly detection methodsthat are faster for large data streams
achieved:
- We optimized the anomaly detection by replacing the deque with a pre-allocated NumPy array for faster rolling window updates and vectorized the entire data stream generation process. 
- This allowed us to calculate seasonal patterns, noise, and anomalies in bulk using efficient NumPy operations. 
- The result is significantly faster execution, improved memory efficiency, and better scalability for larger data streams.
