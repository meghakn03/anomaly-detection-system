Things to work on:

work on concept drift and seasonal variations
achieved:
- Seasonal variations are introduced through the sine wave and noise.
- Concept drift is achieved by adjusting the amplitude of the sine wave over time.
- Dynamic anomaly detection is handled by continuously recalculating the threshold based on the moving window of data points.


optimise by using vectorized operations with NumPy or consider different anomaly detection methodsthat are faster for large data streams
achieved:
- We optimized the anomaly detection by replacing the deque with a pre-allocated NumPy array for faster rolling window updates and vectorized the entire data stream generation process. 
- This allowed us to calculate seasonal patterns, noise, and anomalies in bulk using efficient NumPy operations. 
- The result is significantly faster execution, improved memory efficiency, and better scalability for larger data streams.

Enhanced Reporting and Logging
achieved:
- We improved reporting and logging by implementing a structured logging system that captures key events and anomalies during data processing. 
- Each log entry includes a timestamp, event type, and relevant message, making it easier to trace the flow of operations. 
- Additionally, we enhanced the reporting functionality to generate a comprehensive summary of data stream analysis, including total points processed, anomalies detected, and statistical measures like mean and standard deviation. 
- The report visualization was upgraded to display this information clearly in a bar chart format, with adjustments made to prevent overlapping labels for better readability. 
- Overall, these enhancements provide clearer insights into the data stream and facilitate easier debugging and monitoring of the anomaly detection process.

Real-time Stream Integration

User Interface (UI)

Performance Benchmarking
achieved:
- In our performance benchmarking, we focused on measuring the execution time of the anomaly detection algorithm using varying data sizes. 
- We generated data streams with different sizes (100, 500, 1000, 5000, and 10000 points) to assess the algorithm's efficiency under increasing loads. 
- For each data size, we recorded the time taken to process the data and detect anomalies, storing these results for analysis. 
- We then plotted the benchmark results to visualize the relationship between data size and processing time, highlighting how execution time increased with larger data sets. 
- This systematic approach allowed us to identify performance bottlenecks and evaluate the effectiveness of optimizations implemented in the anomaly detection process.
